# Storing-Data
simple app that uses a tableview and textview to store numbers and calculate their totals. The user inputs a number then clicks add to add it to the list and running total. The user can use the "clear" button to clear the list. This app can store the list and running total when the user exits the app. It will reload the list when the user uses the app.

Day 3: made the app functional: add and clear button work, swipe to delete works, table adds running total
Day 4: implemented storing using UserDefaults
Day 5: README update and photos
